# GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality

Nothing out of this world here — GitHub repositories are basically just a glorified list.

The task is to display the repositories and allow the user to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 

The interface doesn’t need to be unique; feel free to take inspiration from your favourite apps or even the Github interface itself. We would like to see a responsive interface that follows good user experience principles. (As an example of what we mean by this, check out [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/).)
Use the [official GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch repositories per user.
